# Hata (Nanostructural Analysis) Laboratory Homepage
Hata Laboratory develops and uses new methods of electron microscopy for clarifying nanostructures and their relationships with material properties. Hata Laboratory members learn fundamentals and various skills of electron microscopy imaging and analysis to be electron microscopists who can contribute to materials research. Most of the current research projects in Hata Laboratory are collaborative ones with universities and companies.
